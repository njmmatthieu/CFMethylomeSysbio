# Analysis of methylation data within the CF network

Main question: **are there differentially methylated CpG site in the « bodies » of certain genes corresponding to the CF network proteins, built from differential transcriptomic data?**

Methylation data are coming from Magalhães, M., Tost, J., Pineau, F., Rivals, I., Busato, F., Alary, N., … De Sario, A. (2018). Dynamic Changes of DNA Methylation and Lung Disease in Cystic Fibrosis: Lessons from a Monogenic Disease. Epigenomics, 10(8), 1131–1145. https://doi.org/10.2217/epi-2018-0005

Need to download the CFnetwork project before to access CFnetwork data: https://github.com/sysbio-curie/CFnetwork.
